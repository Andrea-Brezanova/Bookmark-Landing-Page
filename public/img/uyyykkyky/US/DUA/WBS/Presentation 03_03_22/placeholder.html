            <h1 class="sticky-sm-top text-uppercase">Red lentil curry</h1>
            <p>This Vegan Red Lentil Curry is a fan favorite and the BEST lentil curry you will ever try! It’s easy and
                quick, making it a perfect weeknight dinner! Plus, it’s creamy and indulgent but made with wholesome
                vegan ingredients!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cook Time: 35 MINS</li>
                <li>Total Time: 45 MINS</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Here’s why you’ll love this Vegan Red Lentil Curry
                Weeknight ready: It’s ready in 35-45 minutes so you can easily make it for a weeknight dinner.

                Creamy and dreamy: This curry is extremely creamy and indulgent. You can thank the full-fat coconut milk
                and the creamy almond butter for that.

                Flavorful beyond belief: It’s packed with flavor thanks to the fresh garlic, ginger, and chili peppers,
                along with a generous dose of Indian spices.

                Nourishing: This red lentil curry might be dangerously delicious and indulgent, but it’s also quite
                nourishing. The garlic, ginger, and turmeric boast tons of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties,
                while the lentils make this a hearty, protein-packed meal. Plus, you’ll stay full for hours due to the
                high content of healthy fat from coconut milk and almond butter.</p>

                <li>2 inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and minced or grated</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh turmeric, or 1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>

                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon Indian red chili powder (if you only have regular chili powder, which is a blend, use 1

                <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>

                <li>Freshly cracked black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 cup (180-190g) red lentils, or split red lentils (the split variety will cook a bit quicker)</li>

                <li>1 (14-ounce / 400g) can crushed tomatoes (or half of a 28-ounce can)</li>
                <li>1 (13.5-ounce/400 mL) can full-fat coconut milk</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened creamy almond butter</li>
                <li>1/2 a small lemon, juiced</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (~8g) fresh cilantro, roughly chopped</li>

            <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
            <p>Rinse the lentils in cold water until the water runs clear.</p>
            <p>Heat a large, deep skillet or large saucepan over medium-high heat and add the coconut oil. Once the oil
                is shimmering, add the garlic, ginger, fresh turmeric (if using), and Serrano pepper and cook for 2
                minutes, stirring frequently to prevent garlic from burning.</p>
            <p>Add the cumin, coriander, chili powder, curry powder, garam masala, salt, and black pepper to taste, and
                cook for 30 to 60 seconds until fragrant, tossing frequently to prevent burning. If using ground
                turmeric instead of fresh turmeric, add the ground turmeric now, along the the rest of the spices.</p>
            <p>Pour in the vegetable broth, and use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up any browned bits on the
                bottom of the pot. Add in the lentils and the crushed tomatoes and mix well. Reduce the heat to low and
                cover the pan with a lid. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through and have
                mostly softened. If you find that the lentils are not quite soft after 25 minutes, add a few spoons more
                of broth or water and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>
            <p>Remove the lid and stir in the coconut milk, almond butter, along with salt and pepper to taste Continue
                cooking on low heat, uncovered for 5 to 8 minutes, until the curry has thickened and is creamy.</p>
            <p>Finally, stir in the lemon juice and cilantro, and turn off the heat. If you want your lentils to even
                creamier and more on the puréed side, use an immersion blender to lightly purée the curry.</p>
            <p>Serve the curry with rice and/or Indian flatbread and garnish with additional cilantro. Store leftovers
                in the fridge for 3-4 days.</p>

            <h6>NOTES</h6>
            <p>If you can’t tolerate spicy food whatsoever, you can omit the chili peppers. If you can handle a little
                heat, use one Serrano pepper (remove the seeds) or one jalapeño pepper (with the seeds), and if you
                really like things on the spicy side, use two Serrano peppers (with seeds intact).
